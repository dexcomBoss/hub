| **Summary**       | Allows a Study or Site Admin to generate a secure, unique invitation for a potential participant to join a specific study site. The invitation is delivered via a temporary email link or a QR code, which directs the participant to the Clinical Hub App (or relevant app store). This process minimizes direct association with PII during the initial invitation. Admins can track invitation status (e.g., accepted).                      |

| **Constraint(s)** | - Generated invitation links/tokens must be unique and time-limited (e.g., expire after 72 hours).<br>- Each token/link should be single-use.<br>- Email addresses, if used, should not be persistently stored in association with the token after sending, adhering to PII minimization principles.<br>- Backend System must track token status (generated, sent, opened, used, expired).<br>- Email links and QR codes must encode a secure deep link that opens the Clinical Hub App or directs to the appropriate app store if the app is not installed.<br>- Admin must be able to view the status of invitations through their interface. |
| **Pre-condition(s)**| - Study Admin or Site Admin is logged in to the Admin Interface.<br>- A study and corresponding site exist.<br>- Admin has identified a potential participant to invite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Post-condition(s)**| **Email:**<br>   - A unique, temporary invitation token is generated by the Backend System.<br>   - A secure email containing a deep link (incorporating the token) is dispatched by the Backend System to the provided participant email address. The link targets the Clinical Hub App/App Store.<br>   - The token status is logged by the Backend System (e.g., generated, sent, expiry time).<br> **QR Code:**<br>   - A unique, temporary invitation token is generated by the Backend System.<br>   - A QR code encoding a deep link (incorporating the token) is generated and displayed to the Admin. The link targets the Clinical Hub App/App Store.<br>   - The token status is logged by the Backend System (e.g., generated, expiry time).<br>**General:**<br>   - Invitation status is updated and viewable by the Admin in their interface. |
| **Trigger**       | Admin selects the option to invite a new participant for a specific study site within the Admin Interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Basic Flow**    | 1. Admin navigates to the participant management section for a specific study site in the Admin Interface.<br>2. Admin initiates the "Invite Participant" action.<br>3. Backend System (via Admin Interface) prompts Admin to choose invitation method: Email or QR Code.<br>4. **If Email:**<br>    a. Admin securely provides the participant's email address.<br>    b. Backend System generates a unique, time-limited, single-use token/deep link.<br>    c. Backend System securely sends an invitation email containing the deep link (to Clinical Hub App/App Store) to the participant.<br>    d. Backend System confirms email dispatch to Admin (via Admin Interface) and logs token generation/sending.<br>5. **If QR Code:**<br>    a. Backend System generates a unique, time-limited, single-use token/deep link.<br>    b. Backend System generates a QR code encoding the deep link (to Clinical Hub App/App Store).<br>    c. Backend System displays the QR code to the Admin via the Admin Interface.<br>    d. Admin shares the QR code with the participant (e.g., print, display on screen).<br>    e. Backend System logs token/QR code generation.<br>6. (Participant action - outside this UC) Participant scans the QR code or clicks the link.<br>    a. The device attempts to open the Clinical Hub App or directs the user to the app store.<br>    b. Upon opening the app (after potential install), the app processes the token from the deep link to initiate the site-specific enrollment process.<br>    c. The Backend System validates the token and marks it as opened/used upon successful enrollment initiation, updating the status viewable by the Admin. |
| **Alternate Flows**| - **Token Expiry:** If a participant tries to use an expired link/QR code, the Backend System (via the Clinical Hub App) prevents enrollment and informs them the invitation is no longer valid.<br>- **Token Already Used:** If a participant tries to use a link/QR code that has already been used, the Backend System (via the Clinical Hub App) prevents enrollment and informs them the invitation has already been claimed.                                                                                             |
| **Exceptions**    | - **Invalid Email Address:** Backend System (via Admin Interface) displays an error if the email format is invalid.<br>- **Email Sending Failure:** Backend System notifies the Admin (via Admin Interface) of the failure and logs the error. The token might be reusable or a new one needs generation.<br>- **Backend System Error:** Backend System displays an error message (via Admin Interface or potentially Clinical Hub App if error occurs during participant flow) and logs the error during token/QR generation, email sending, or validation.                                                                    |
| **Additional Info**| - This process decouples the initial invitation from direct PII storage in the Backend System logs.<br>- Participant PII is collected during the enrollment process within the Clinical Hub App, initiated via the link/QR code.<br>- The token tracking table (managed by Backend System) might include fields like `token_id`, `study_id`, `site_id`, `status` (generated, sent, opened, used, expired), `expires_at`, `created_at`, `used_at`, potentially `source_ip` or device info upon usage. |
